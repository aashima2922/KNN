A well-known machine learning technique, the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm is implemented in order to perform classification and regression. The KNN algorithm can be utilised to classify instances as malignant or non-cancerous in the context of cancer detection, utilising features extracted from medical data.
